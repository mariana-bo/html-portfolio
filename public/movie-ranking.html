<h1> The Best Movies According to Mariana </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>
<hr />

<h3> Life Is Beautiful </h3>
<p> This is a heartbreaking but beautiful movie. The mix of comical elements in the midst of the tragic events occurring is very well done.</p>

<h3> Parasite </h3>
<p> The uncomfortableness I felt when watching this movie in the cinema is one I will never forget. The plot, the visual and sound effects, the acting and the social critic behind it, all make this movie completely worth watching.</p>

<h3> A Man Called Otto </h3>
<p> This movie made me sob. This is a movie made by the characters and their interactions and emotions and not by a crazy plot. I really liked it.</p>
